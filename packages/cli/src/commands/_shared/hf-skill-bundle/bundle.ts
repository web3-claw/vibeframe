/**
 * @module _shared/hf-skill-bundle
 *
 * Loads the vendored Hyperframes skill content as a single concatenated
 * system-prompt string. Used by `compose-scenes-with-skills` (v0.59+).
 *
 * Hyperframes (https://github.com/heygen-com/hyperframes, Apache 2.0)
 * publishes this skill content as the agent-loadable definition of its
 * composition craft. VibeFrame is not affiliated with HeyGen — see
 * `/CREDITS.md` and `./NOTICE` for the relationship + license obligations
 * VibeFrame honours.
 *
 * Sourcing order (highest precedence first):
 *   1. User-installed skill — `~/.claude/skills/hyperframes/` (read at runtime
 *      via readFileSync — kept fresh by the user's `npx skills update` flow)
 *   2. Vendored snapshot in this directory (always available, even after
 *      `npm install -g @vibeframe/cli` because the .md files are inlined
 *      into the esbuild bundle via the text loader — see `build.js`)
 *
 * The vendored copy is byte-identical to upstream: no semantic edits. We
 * mirror Hyperframes' own treatment of prior art (see their CREDITS.md
 * "Prior art" section about Remotion). Refresh the snapshot with
 * `scripts/refresh-hf-bundle.sh`, which re-copies from a sibling clone of
 * the upstream repo and bumps BUNDLE_VERSION.
 *
 * The cache for `compose-scenes-with-skills` keys on `BUNDLE_VERSION` (folded
 * into the hash) so snapshot upgrades automatically invalidate previously-cached
 * HTML.
