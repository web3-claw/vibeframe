#
# scripts/record-vhs.sh — Re-render the VHS demos in assets/demos/.
#
# Prerequisites (all macOS / Linux):
#   - vhs       — `brew install vhs` (macOS) or download from
#                 https://github.com/charmbracelet/vhs/releases (Linux)
#   - claude    — `claude` on PATH; Claude Code drives both recordings
#   - API keys required by DEMO-quickstart.md / DEMO-dogfood.md in env
#
# What it produces:
#   assets/demos/quickstart-claude-code.mp4 — public quickstart recording
#   assets/demos/dogfood-claude-code.mp4    — fuller contributor dogfood recording
#
# The script builds the local CLI and places a temporary `vibe` wrapper first
# on PATH, so recordings exercise this checkout. Both recordings make real
# provider calls. Set ONLY=quickstart or ONLY=dogfood to render one tape.
