# VibeFrame Quickstart Demo

This is the copy-paste first-run demo for a human or coding agent driving the
installed `vibe` CLI from a clean directory.

The primary workflow is storyboard-first:

```text
brief
-> STORYBOARD.md and DESIGN.md
-> plan and dry-run
-> build assets/compositions
-> inspect reports
-> repair deterministic issues
-> render MP4
```

The quickstart recording should follow this storyboard-first project loop.
Lower-level media primitives remain documented later as compatibility tools,
but they are no longer the primary first-run path.

For the longer repo dogfood run, see [DEMO-dogfood.md](DEMO-dogfood.md).

## 0. Setup

Install:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://vibeframe.ai/install.sh | bash
```

Create a clean demo workspace:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/dev/vibeframe-demo
cd ~/dev/vibeframe-demo
```

Configure project-local settings and verify the machine:

```bash
vibe setup --scope project
vibe doctor
vibe context
vibe schema --list --surface public --json
```

Recommended keys for the full paid path:

| Key                                 | Used for                                        |
| ----------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY`                    | image generation and optional batch composition |
| `FAL_API_KEY`                       | Seedance image/video generation                 |
| `GOOGLE_API_KEY`                    | render review and media understanding           |
| `IMGBB_API_KEY` or S3 upload config | temporary image URL for image-to-video          |

The main quickstart below uses Kokoro narration and can skip generated
backdrops/video/music for a low-cost first pass.

---

## 1. Start A Storyboard Project

### User prompt

Paste this to Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, or another agent running in the demo
directory:

```text
Create a 24 second launch video called apex-story.
Use a calm mountain sunrise identity.
The final output should be a reviewed MP4.
Use STORYBOARD.md and DESIGN.md as the source of truth, dry-run before
spending, keep cost under $5, and write JSON reports for the next agent pass.
```

### Command the agent should run

```bash
vibe init apex-story \
  --from "24-second calm mountain sunrise launch video for Apex Ridge" \
  --profile agent \
  --visual-style "Swiss Pulse" \
  -r 16:9 \
  -d 24 \
  --json
```

Expected files:

```text
apex-story/STORYBOARD.md
apex-story/DESIGN.md
apex-story/vibe.config.json
apex-story/AGENTS.md
```

Gate the generated intent before spending. A clean draft should not contain
starter placeholder cues such as `from the brief`, `_hex_`, or
`_anti-pattern`. At this point `MISSING_ROOT_COMPOSITION` and
`MISSING_COMPOSITION` findings are expected because build has not run yet.

```bash
vibe inspect project apex-story --json
```

---

## 2. Review Or Author The Intent Files

Agents can directly edit Markdown for larger creative changes. For narrow cue
edits, prefer `vibe storyboard set/get/move/list`. The `init --from` command
should already produce concrete narration, backdrop, and motion cues. If you
want this demo to be byte-for-byte stable, replace the files with the version
below.

Optional stable `apex-story/DESIGN.md`:

```markdown
# Design

## Style

Calm cinematic mountain documentary. Golden sunrise, layered fog, clean
developer-tool editorial pacing, restrained type, no mascot or cartoon styling.

## Palette

- `#0E1622` - ridge shadow
- `#E8B36A` - sunrise gold
- `#F5EEE2` - warm title text
- `#6EE7B7` - success accent

## Typography

Inter or system sans-serif. Medium weight, generous spacing, short labels.

## Motion

Slow camera drift, soft fades, subtle parallax, no bounce or elastic motion.
```

Optional stable `apex-story/STORYBOARD.md`:

````markdown
# Apex Story

## Beat hook - First light

```yaml
duration: 6
narration: "The first light finds the ridge before the world wakes."
backdrop: "misty mountain ridge at sunrise, golden light, fog layers, cinematic aerial frame"
video: "slow camera drift forward over the peak, fog moving gently"
motion: "quiet title reveal, soft parallax, restrained lower-third"
voice: "af_heart"
music: "minimal warm pulse, low intensity"
```

Show the mountain identity immediately. Keep text minimal.

## Beat proof - The path appears

```yaml
duration: 6
narration: "A clear path appears when every step is visible."
backdrop: "ridge trail emerging through fog, warm sunrise edge light, high contrast"
motion: "thin line traces the path, small labels fade in"
voice: "af_heart"
```

Connect the visual path to the product promise.

## Beat mechanism - Built from files

```yaml
duration: 6
narration: "A storyboard becomes files, reports, scenes, and a render plan."
backdrop: "developer terminal beside storyboard markdown and structured report cards"
motion: "STORYBOARD.md, build-report.json, and review-report.json cards slide into place"
voice: "af_heart"
```

Make the file-based workflow visible.

## Beat close - Day one

```yaml
duration: 6
narration: "Apex Ridge. Day one begins here."
backdrop: "wide mountain ridge at peak golden hour, valley filled with warm light"
motion: "clean lower-third title, slow fade to final frame"
voice: "af_heart"
```

End with a quiet branded title.
````

Validate the storyboard:

```bash
vibe storyboard validate apex-story --json
vibe storyboard list apex-story --json
```

---

## 3. Plan And Dry-Run

Read the storyboard and show provider needs, missing cues, and estimated cost:

```bash
vibe plan apex-story \
  --mode batch \
  --composer openai \
  --tts kokoro \
  --skip-backdrop \
  --skip-video \
  --skip-music \
  --max-cost 5 \
  --json
```

This low-cost path skips generated backdrops, video, and music. It is a
composition and narration smoke test. Use the paid asset path later when you
want richer visual media.

Preview the build before creating assets or compositions:

```bash
vibe build apex-story \
  --dry-run \
  --mode batch \
  --composer openai \
  --tts kokoro \
  --skip-backdrop \
  --skip-video \
  --skip-music \
  --max-cost 5 \
  --json
```

This writes no media. It should return a JSON envelope with the build plan,
warnings, cost estimate, and retry suggestions if something is missing.

---

## 4. Build, Inspect, Repair, Render

Build the storyboard project while keeping the render as a separate step:

```bash
vibe build apex-story \
  --mode batch \
  --composer openai \
  --tts kokoro \
  --skip-backdrop \
  --skip-video \
  --skip-music \
  --skip-render \
  --max-cost 5 \
  --json
```

The build writes asset freshness metadata under `.vibeframe/assets/`. If a
storyboard cue changes later, `vibe plan` and `vibe build` can distinguish a
fresh canonical asset from stale narration or imagery.
In paid paths, completed async video/music jobs are folded back into
`build-report.json` by `vibe status project --refresh`, and the sync stage
wires ready narration and music into the root timeline.

If the build starts async provider jobs in a paid path, poll the project:

```bash
vibe status project apex-story --refresh --json
```

Inspect generated project artifacts:

```bash
vibe inspect project apex-story --json
```

Apply deterministic mechanical repairs:

```bash
vibe scene repair apex-story --json
```

Render the final MP4:

```bash
vibe render apex-story \
  -o renders/storyboard-demo.mp4 \
  --quality standard \
  --fps 30 \
  --json
```

Inspect the rendered video locally:

```bash
vibe inspect render apex-story \
  --video renders/storyboard-demo.mp4 \
  --cheap \
  --json
```

Check the report summary. Static holds, long silence, missing audio, duration
drift, and semantic AI findings should include `fixOwner` and, when possible,
`beatId`/`timeRange`:

```bash
node -e 'const r=require("./apex-story/review-report.json"); console.log(JSON.stringify({status:r.status, score:r.score, summary:r.summary, retryWith:r.retryWith}, null, 2))'
```

Optional AI review:

```bash
vibe inspect render apex-story \
  --video renders/storyboard-demo.mp4 \
  --ai \
  --json
```

AI render review uses `STORYBOARD.md`, `DESIGN.md`, beat timing, and
`build-report.json` as context. When possible, `review-report.json` issues
include `beatId`, `timeRange`, `fixOwner`, and `suggestedFix`.
Cheap render review also flags long static holds, black frames, duration drift,
missing audio, and long silence before you spend on AI critique.

Expected files:

```text
apex-story/build-report.json
apex-story/review-report.json
apex-story/compositions/
apex-story/renders/storyboard-demo.mp4
```

Expected local review issue codes, when problems exist:

```text
STATIC_FRAME_SEGMENT
LONG_SILENCE
DURATION_DRIFT
NO_AUDIO_STREAM
BLACK_FRAME_SEGMENT
```

If `review-report.json` contains semantic issues, ask the host agent to fix
them from the report:

```bash
codex "fix issues from apex-story/review-report.json"
```

Then rerun:

```bash
vibe build apex-story \
  --stage all \
  --mode batch \
  --composer openai \
  --tts kokoro \
  --skip-backdrop \
  --skip-video \
  --skip-music \
  --force \
  --skip-render \
  --json
vibe scene repair apex-story --json
vibe render apex-story -o renders/storyboard-demo.mp4 --json
vibe inspect render apex-story --video renders/storyboard-demo.mp4 --cheap --json
```

---

## 5. Focus One Beat During Iteration

Use the storyboard mutation API for narrow changes:

```bash
vibe storyboard get apex-story hook --json
vibe storyboard set apex-story hook narration "First light reaches the ridge before the world wakes." --json
vibe storyboard validate apex-story --json
```

Rebuild and inspect just that beat:

```bash
vibe build apex-story --beat hook --stage assets --skip-backdrop --skip-video --skip-music --force --json
vibe build apex-story --beat hook --stage compose --mode batch --composer openai --json
vibe build apex-story --beat hook --stage sync --json
vibe inspect project apex-story --beat hook --json
vibe render apex-story --beat hook --json
vibe inspect render apex-story --beat hook --cheap --json
```

---

## 6. Paid Asset Path

The low-cost path above skips generated backdrops, videos, and music. To
exercise the full asset orchestration path, raise the cap and choose providers:

```bash
vibe build apex-story \
  --mode batch \
  --composer openai \
  --tts kokoro \
  --image-provider openai \
  --video-provider seedance \
  --music-provider elevenlabs \
  --max-cost 25 \
  --json
```

If you only want generated still backdrops, keep video and music skipped:

```bash
vibe build apex-story \
  --mode batch \
  --composer openai \
  --tts kokoro \
  --image-provider openai \
  --skip-video \
  --skip-music \
  --max-cost 15 \
  --json
```

---

## 7. Media Primitives Demo

Use these commands when you need one standalone asset or you want to reproduce
the older quickstart recording.

```bash
mkdir -p assets renders

vibe generate image \
  "aerial view of a misty mountain peak at sunrise, golden hour light, layered fog, cinematic 16:9" \
  -p openai \
  -m 2 \
  --size 1536x1024 \
  --quality hd \
  --style natural \
  -o assets/peak.png

vibe generate video \
  "slow cinematic camera drift forward over the mountain peak, fog moving gently, sunrise light strengthening" \
  -p seedance \
  -i assets/peak.png \
  -d 6 \
  -r 16:9 \
  -o assets/peak-seedance.mp4

vibe inspect media \
  assets/peak-seedance.mp4 \
  "Describe the mood, motion, and safest lower-third region." \
  --fps 1 \
  --low-res

vibe edit motion-overlay \
  assets/peak-seedance.mp4 \
  "minimal lower-third title 'Day One - Apex Ridge', bottom-left, clean white sans-serif, subtle film grain, warm vignette" \
  --understand auto \
  -m gemini \
  --duration 6 \
  --style cinematic \
  -o renders/peak-titled.mp4
```

## 8. Expected File Tree

```text
.
+-- apex-story/
|   +-- AGENTS.md
|   +-- DESIGN.md
|   +-- STORYBOARD.md
|   +-- assets/
|   +-- build-report.json
|   +-- compositions/
|   +-- renders/
|   |   +-- storyboard-demo.mp4
|   +-- review-report.json
|   +-- vibe.config.json
+-- assets/
|   +-- peak.png
|   +-- peak-seedance.mp4
+-- renders/
    +-- peak-titled.mp4
```

Pixels vary by provider, model, and seed. The command routing, project files,
JSON reports, and render location should stay stable.
