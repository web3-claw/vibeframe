# VibeFrame

**Ship videos, not clicks. The CLI is your agent's UI.**

A video CLI for the era when your AI coding agent ships the work. Works with **Claude Code**, **OpenAI Codex**, **Cursor**, **Aider**, **Gemini CLI**, **OpenCode** — any bash-capable AI agent. 100+ commands, 13 AI providers, 66 MCP tools, YAML pipelines.

> Every edit is a command. `vibe doctor` auto-detects your agent host; `vibe init` scaffolds the right project files. The CLI surface is identical across every host — your agent shells out, gets work done, ships the MP4.

### Why a CLI?

Because in 2026 your agent already lives in your terminal. Three signals that crystallized this year:

- **10–32× cheaper than MCP per task** — 75-task study comparing CLI vs. MCP-tool-driven agents ([The New Stack](https://thenewstack.io/ai-coding-tools-in-2025-welcome-to-the-agentic-cli-era/))
- **6 major repos launched Q1 2026** with the same premise — *"give existing software a structured CLI so AI agents can use it"* ([OSS Insight](https://ossinsight.io/blog/agent-native-cli-wave-2026))
- **74% of developers** use AI coding tools today ([JetBrains AI Pulse, Jan 2026](https://blog.jetbrains.com/research/2026/04/which-ai-coding-tools-do-developers-actually-use-at-work/))

Today's software was built for humans clicking buttons. VibeFrame is built for the era when your software's primary user is an AI agent.

## Demo

A cinematic 1920×1080 promo, end-to-end from a `STORYBOARD.md` + `DESIGN.md`
through the v0.59 `compose-scenes-with-skills` pipeline. Three beats, GPT
Image 2 backdrops, ElevenLabs narration + cinematic BGM, all rendered
deterministically by Hyperframes' producer.

### Reproduce the surfaces locally

`assets/demos/` ships VHS tapes for every surface — run any with
[`vhs`](https://github.com/charmbracelet/vhs):

```bash
brew install vhs
vhs assets/demos/cli.tape              # Surface 1 — vibe CLI directly
vhs assets/demos/agent.tape            # Surface 2 — vibe agent (built-in REPL, BYO LLM)
vhs assets/demos/host-agent.tape       # Surface 3 — host agent driving vibe scene build
vhs assets/demos/host-agent-i2v.tape   # Surface 4 — host agent t2i + i2v + narration
```

> The Surface 3/4 tapes were recorded with Claude Code (it's the agent we use day-to-day), but the same `vibe` commands run identically when driven by Codex / Cursor / Aider / Gemini CLI / OpenCode — the host agent is just translating natural language into the same shell command. Re-record on your favourite host with `vhs <tape>` after exporting that host's API key.

> **New in v0.60:** `vibe scene build` is the one-shot driver — write a `STORYBOARD.md` with per-beat YAML cues (narration / backdrop / duration), and a single command dispatches TTS + GPT Image 2 + composes scene HTML via the `compose-scenes-with-skills` pipeline (v0.59) and renders to MP4. `vibe scene init --visual-style "Swiss Pulse"` (v0.58) still seeds the `DESIGN.md` hard-gate + 8 named visual identities. Hyperframes' `/hyperframes` skill (`npx skills add heygen-com/hyperframes`) is loaded as the LLM system prompt for composition craft.

For the typed MCP route (Claude Desktop, Cursor, OpenCode, or Claude Code via `claude mcp add`), see [`packages/mcp-server/README.md`](packages/mcp-server/README.md).

## Why VibeFrame?

Traditional video editors are built for **clicking buttons**. VibeFrame is built for **AI-powered workflows** — a well-designed CLI that AI agents can compose, pipe, and script.

| Traditional Editor | VibeFrame |
|-------------------|----------|
| Import → Drag → Trim → Export | `vibe edit silence-cut interview.mp4 -o clean.mp4` |
| Manual scene detection | `vibe detect scenes video.mp4` |
| Export for each platform | `vibe pipeline auto-shorts project.vibe.json` |
| Click through menus | Natural language → CLI → done |

### Built on Hyperframes

VibeFrame is **not** a competitor to [Hyperframes](https://github.com/heygen-com/hyperframes) (Apache 2.0) — it builds on it. Hyperframes solves the hard rendering problem (Chrome BeginFrame deterministic capture, parity harness, native HDR pipeline, Studio editor) and VibeFrame uses it as a render backend (`vibe export --backend hyperframes` since v0.47, `vibe scene` produces Hyperframes-compatible HTML since v0.53). The two layers are complementary:

- **Hyperframes** — HTML composition format · deterministic rendering · Studio editor · native HDR · local Kokoro TTS · local whisper-cpp transcribe · agent skill ecosystem (`hyperframes`, `gsap`, `hyperframes-cli`, `hyperframes-registry`, `website-to-hyperframes`)
- **VibeFrame** — 13 AI generation providers (image/video/audio) · agent integrations (MCP, REPL) · traditional editing/analysis commands · multi-stage YAML pipelines

VibeFrame's `compose-scenes-with-skills` action (v0.59+) loads Hyperframes' `hyperframes` skill content as the system prompt for Claude-driven scene HTML generation. We use the user's installed copy when present (`npx skills add heygen-com/hyperframes`); otherwise the bundle ships a vendored snapshot for offline / CI safety. Provenance and the full relationship are documented in [`CREDITS.md`](CREDITS.md). VibeFrame is not affiliated with HeyGen.

See [`docs/comparison.md`](docs/comparison.md) for a measured side-by-side of `vibe scene render` vs `npx hyperframes render` on the same project — same h264 stream both directions, +33 KB for the AAC narration track. Reproducible with [`tests/comparison/render-bench.sh`](tests/comparison/render-bench.sh).

### What VibeFrame adds on top

| Layer | Hyperframes | VibeFrame |
|---|---|---|
| **AI generation** | — | OpenAI gpt-image-2 (image default since v0.56), fal.ai Seedance 2.0 (video default since v0.57), Veo, Kling, Runway, Grok, ElevenLabs, Replicate |
| **Agent integrations** | — | MCP server (66 tools, `@vibeframe/mcp-server`) · `vibe agent` REPL (BYO LLM × 6) |
| **Traditional editing** | — | `vibe edit` silence-cut · jump-cut · caption · grade · reframe · speed-ramp · fade · noise-reduce (100+ commands total) |
| **AI analysis** | — | `vibe analyze` media/video/review/suggest (multimodal LLMs) |
| **BUILD from text** | composition format only | `vibe scene build` (v0.60 one-shot driver) — STORYBOARD.md → MP4 |
| **PROCESS existing video** | — | `vibe pipeline highlights` · `auto-shorts` · `animated-caption` |
| **Video as Code** | composition is somewhat declarative | `vibe run pipeline.yaml` · `--dry-run` cost preview · `--resume` checkpoints · step references (`$step.output`) |
| **Local Kokoro TTS** | ✅ Python `kokoro-onnx` | ✅ Node `kokoro-js` — same Kokoro-82M model, auto-fallback when no `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY` |
| **Local Whisper transcribe** | ✅ whisper-cpp (offline) | OpenAI Whisper API (cloud, word-level) |
| **Agent skills** | ✅ `npx skills add heygen-com/hyperframes` (5 skills via vercel-labs/skills) | ✅ universal `vibe walkthrough <topic>` (scene / pipeline) — same content as Claude Code's `/vibe-scene` and `/vibe-pipeline` slash commands, callable from any host. Project guidance in `AGENTS.md` (`vibe init`). |
| **MCP server** | ❌ | ✅ 66 tools |
| **Render** | ✅ native (BeginFrame, parity, HDR, Studio NLE) | uses Hyperframes backend or FFmpeg |
| **License** | Apache 2.0 | MIT |
| **OSS provider plugin** | — | `defineProvider({...})` registry — adding an AI provider is a single declaration; resolver / config / setup / doctor / `.env.example` all auto-derive (`pnpm scaffold:provider <name>` for the boilerplate) |

The short version: **if you already write HTML compositions and want them rendered well, use Hyperframes directly. If you want AI to *write* those compositions for you, edit them traditionally, surface them to your AI coding agent via MCP or shell, or stitch a multi-stage AI pipeline — that's VibeFrame.**

**Design Principles:** CLI-First — AI-Native — Provider Agnostic — MCP Compatible

---

## Quick Start (CLI)

**Prerequisites:** Node.js 20+, FFmpeg

CLI-first. Every video edit is a command.

```bash
# Install
curl -fsSL https://vibeframe.ai/install.sh | bash

# Remove silence from an interview
vibe edit silence-cut interview.mp4 -o clean.mp4

# Add captions with auto-transcription
vibe edit caption video.mp4 -o captioned.mp4

# Build a cinematic promo from a STORYBOARD (v0.60)
vibe scene init my-promo --visual-style "Swiss Pulse" -d 12
# (edit STORYBOARD.md with three beats)
vibe scene build my-promo

# Export to MP4
vibe export project.vibe.json -o output.mp4
```

**Try without API keys** (FFmpeg only, free):

```bash
# Detect scene changes in a video
vibe detect scenes video.mp4

# Remove silence from an interview
vibe edit silence-cut interview.mp4 -o clean.mp4

# Add fade in/out effects
vibe edit fade video.mp4 -o faded.mp4 --fade-in 1 --fade-out 1

# Remove background noise
vibe edit noise-reduce video.mp4 -o clean.mp4

# Detect beats in audio
vibe detect beats music.mp3
```

For development:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vericontext/vibeframe.git
cd vibeframe
pnpm install && pnpm build
```

### Render backends

By default, `vibe export` uses FFmpeg. Since v0.47.0, a **Hyperframes** backend is available (experimental) — renders VibeFrame timelines through a Chrome BeginFrame → FFmpeg pipeline, unlocking CSS animations. v0.50.0 adds **Lottie overlays**: add any `.lottie` source with `vibe timeline add-source project.vibe.json anim.lottie` (or `--type lottie` for `.json`) and render with `vibe export --backend hyperframes`.

```bash
# Default (FFmpeg)
vibe export project.vibe.json -o output.mp4

# Hyperframes backend (experimental — requires Chrome)
vibe export project.vibe.json -o output.mp4 --backend hyperframes

# Check Chrome detection
vibe doctor
```

Or in a YAML pipeline:

```yaml
render:
  backend: hyperframes
  fps: 30
  quality: standard
```

---

## Use with your AI agent

VibeFrame is a bash CLI. Any AI coding agent that can shell out to a terminal can drive it — describe what you want in natural language, and the agent invokes the right `vibe` command.

| You say | Agent runs |
|---------|-----------|
| "Remove silence from interview.mp4" | `vibe edit silence-cut interview.mp4 -o clean.mp4` |
| "Extract 3 best moments from podcast.mp4" | `vibe pipeline highlights podcast.mp4 -c 3` |
| "Add Korean subtitles to video.mp4" | `vibe edit caption video.mp4 -o captioned.mp4` |
| "Build a 12-second cinematic promo" | `vibe scene init promo && vibe scene build promo` |
| "Remove background noise" | `vibe edit noise-reduce noisy.mp4 -o clean.mp4` |
| "Make a 60-second highlight reel" | `vibe pipeline highlights long-video.mp4 -d 60` |

The example above is host-agnostic — every command works identically across Claude Code, OpenAI Codex, Cursor, Aider, Gemini CLI, OpenCode, or any other agent that runs bash.

### Agent host support

`vibe doctor` auto-detects six host families today and `vibe init` scaffolds the right project guidance file for each. Anyone running another bash-capable agent still gets the universal `AGENTS.md` fallback.

| Host | `vibe init` writes | Plan H skill layout (`vibe scene install-skill`) |
|---|---|---|
| **Claude Code** | `CLAUDE.md` (imports `@AGENTS.md`) + `AGENTS.md` | `.claude/skills/hyperframes/` (multi-file, Agent Skills standard) |
| **OpenAI Codex** | `AGENTS.md` | universal `SKILL.md` (read via `AGENTS.md` ref) |
| **Cursor** | `AGENTS.md` | `.cursor/rules/hyperframes.mdc` (auto-activates on `compositions/**/*.html`) |
| **Aider** | `AGENTS.md` | universal `SKILL.md` |
| **Gemini CLI** | `AGENTS.md` (its primary `GEMINI.md` is on the roadmap) | universal `SKILL.md` |
| **OpenCode** | `AGENTS.md` | universal `SKILL.md` |
| Any other bash agent | `AGENTS.md` (with `--agent all`) | universal `SKILL.md` |

`vibe scene build --mode auto` auto-flips to the agentic compose path (no internal LLM call — host agent authors per-beat HTML directly) whenever any of the above hosts is present. Set `VIBE_BUILD_MODE=batch` to force the internal-LLM compose path instead.

### Step-by-step authoring guides

`vibe walkthrough` ships a built-in catalog of authoring guides — universal across every host, no slash menu required:

```bash
vibe walkthrough              # list available topics
vibe walkthrough scene        # full scene-authoring guide (BUILD flow)
vibe walkthrough pipeline     # full YAML-pipeline authoring guide (Video as Code)
vibe walkthrough scene --json # structured shape for an agent host to consume
```

Same content the `/vibe-scene` and `/vibe-pipeline` slash commands deliver in Claude Code — works identically when called from any other host. Claude Code users can keep the slash menu as a one-keystroke shortcut (install via `curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vericontext/vibeframe/main/scripts/install-skills.sh | bash`); the underlying guide is the same.

---

## MCP Integration (Claude Desktop / Cursor / OpenCode / Claude Code)

The CLI is the primary interface; MCP is the gateway for hosts that prefer typed JSON-RPC tool calls over shelling out. 66 MCP tools exposed via [`@vibeframe/mcp-server`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@vibeframe/mcp-server). No clone needed — add to your config and restart:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "vibeframe": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@vibeframe/mcp-server"]
    }
  }
}
```

Config file locations:
- **Claude Desktop (macOS):** `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
- **Claude Desktop (Windows):** `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`
- **Cursor:** `.cursor/mcp.json` in your workspace
- **OpenCode:** `.opencode/mcp.json` in your workspace
- **Claude Code:** add via `claude mcp add @vibeframe/mcp-server -- npx -y @vibeframe/mcp-server` (Claude Code has both shell and MCP routes — pick whichever fits)

See [packages/mcp-server/README.md](packages/mcp-server/README.md) for full tool, resource, and prompt reference.

---

## Video as Code

Define reproducible video workflows in YAML. Each step maps to a CLI command.

```yaml
# promo.yaml
name: promo-video
steps:
  - id: backdrop
    action: generate-image
    prompt: "modern tech studio"
    output: backdrop.png
  - id: narration
    action: generate-tts
    text: "Introducing the future of video editing."
    output: voice.mp3
  - id: video
    action: generate-video
    image: $backdrop.output     # reference previous step
    prompt: "camera push in"
    output: scene.mp4
```

```bash
vibe run promo.yaml --dry-run     # preview plan + cost estimate
vibe run promo.yaml               # execute pipeline
vibe run promo.yaml --resume      # retry from last checkpoint
```

See [`examples/README.md`](examples/README.md) for the catalog — three runnable YAML pipelines (offline / AI promo / budget-capped) plus a bilingual `scene-promo/` project.

---

## AI Pipelines (PROCESS existing video)

`vibe pipeline` takes a finished video and transforms it. For BUILD-from-text
flows, use `vibe scene build` (see Scene Authoring below).

```bash
vibe pipeline highlights interview.mp4 -d 90 --criteria emotional
vibe pipeline auto-shorts podcast.mp4
vibe pipeline animated-caption video.mp4 -s bounce -o captioned.mp4
```

> [!NOTE]
> **`pipeline script-to-video` was removed in v0.63** in favour of `vibe scene build` — the skill-driven flow is cheaper, idempotent, and per-beat editable. `pipeline regenerate-scene` is preserved for re-rendering individual scenes against an existing storyboard.{yaml,json}.

---

## Scene Authoring (HTML, not MP4)

Since v0.53.0, `vibe scene` produces **editable per-scene HTML** instead of
opaque MP4s. Each scene is a self-contained HTML file with scoped CSS and a
paused GSAP timeline — text tweaks don't require regenerating video.

```bash
vibe scene init my-promo -r 16:9 -d 30
vibe scene add intro --style announcement --headline "Ship videos, not clicks"
vibe scene add core  --style explainer --kicker "VIDEO AS CODE" \
                     --headline "Author scenes, not timelines"
vibe scene lint                        # in-process Hyperframes linter
vibe scene render -o promo.mp4         # requires Chrome
```

Scene projects are bilingual — they work with both `vibe` and
[`npx hyperframes`](https://github.com/heygen-com/hyperframes).

### One-shot build (v0.60)

When the project has a `STORYBOARD.md` with per-beat YAML cues, a single
command dispatches all primitives + composes + renders:

```bash
vibe scene build my-promo                 # storyboard → narration + backdrops + MP4
vibe scene build --skip-render            # compose only (review HTML before rendering)
vibe scene build --tts kokoro --voice af_heart   # override frontmatter providers
```

Per-beat cues live as a fenced \`\`\`yaml block at the start of each beat body:

```markdown
## Beat hook — Hook

\`\`\`yaml
narration: "Type a YAML."
backdrop: "Abstract minimalist tech aesthetic, electric blue glow"
duration: 3
\`\`\`
```

Idempotent: existing assets are reused, `--force` overrides. See
[`examples/vibeframe-promo/`](examples/vibeframe-promo/) for the
end-to-end fixture (the same project that produced the cinematic hero
above).

### Free local TTS + word-level caption sync (v0.54)

`vibe scene add --narration "..."` now works with **no API key**. Without
`ELEVENLABS_API_KEY`, VibeFrame falls back to **Kokoro-82M** (Apache 2.0)
running locally — first call downloads ~330MB to
`~/.cache/huggingface/hub`, then renders are free.

```bash
# Free local TTS (Kokoro)
vibe scene add hook --narration "Ship videos, not clicks." --tts kokoro

# Or use any external wav (npx hyperframes tts, macOS say, voice memo)
vibe scene add hook --narration-file ./my-voice.wav
```

Whenever audio is present and `OPENAI_API_KEY` is set, narration is
auto-transcribed (Whisper word-level) into `assets/transcript-<id>.json`
and threaded into the scene HTML. Captions then **fade in word-by-word at
the exact audio timestamp** — no more "scene says X but caption shows Y"
drift. Supported on `simple`, `explainer`, and `kinetic-type` presets.

In v0.55, `vibe scene render` adds a post-producer **ffmpeg audio mux
pass** so the rendered MP4 actually carries the narration track instead
of being silent. `-c:v copy` keeps it cheap (no video re-encode); the
render JSON reports `audioCount` + `audioMuxApplied` for agent
introspection.

Run [`examples/scene-promo/`](examples/scene-promo/) for an end-to-end
walkthrough. See `/vibe-scene` for the agent skill, including the lint
feedback loop pattern (`--json --fix`, ≤3 retries, template fallback).

---

## CLI Reference

Every command supports `--help`, `--json`, `--dry-run`, `--stdin`, and `--describe`. Run `vibe --help` for a full list, or `vibe schema --list` for a machine-readable index.

| **Setup & utility** | `setup`, `init`, `doctor`, `agent`, `walkthrough`, `demo`, `schema`, `context` | `vibe doctor` · `vibe init my-project` |

> [!NOTE]
> Removed in recent releases: `pipeline script-to-video` (v0.63 → use `vibe scene build`), `vibe ai *` orchestrator (v0.69), and the `dalle` alias (v0.69 — use `vibe generate image -p openai`).

See [Cookbook](docs/cookbook.md) for 10 practical recipes combining multiple commands.

---

## Agent Mode (Standalone)

For environments with no AI coding agent set up — a built-in interactive session:

```bash
vibe agent                     # Start (default: OpenAI)
vibe agent -p claude           # Use Claude
vibe agent -p ollama           # Free, local, no API key
```

Best used for onboarding and quick experiments. For production workflows, use CLI commands directly or via your host agent / MCP.

---
