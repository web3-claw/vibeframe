const SCENE_WALKTHROUGH = `# Scene authoring with vibe

A scene project is a directory that is **bilingual**: it works with both
\`vibe\` and \`npx hyperframes\`. Each scene is one HTML file with scoped CSS
and a paused GSAP timeline. Cheap to edit, cheap to lint, expensive only
at render.

\`vibe build\` (v0.60+) is the supported one-shot driver from a
written storyboard to an MP4. Plan H (v0.70) added \`--mode agent\` so the
host agent itself authors the per-beat HTML — no internal LLM call.

## Three authoring paths

| Path | Command | When to use |
|---|---|---|
| **One-shot (default, v0.60+)** | \`vibe build [project-dir]\` | STORYBOARD.md has YAML frontmatter + per-beat cues |
| **High-craft (manual)** | \`DESIGN.md\` + local composition rules in your agent | Maximum control: hand-author each scene |
| **Quick draft** | \`vibe scene add --style <preset>\` | No agent or no API keys; fast iteration |

Recommend \`vibe build\` whenever the user has a STORYBOARD with
narration / backdrop intent.

## High-craft path

1. \`vibe init my-promo --visual-style "Swiss Pulse"\` — seeds
   \`DESIGN.md\` (palette, typography, motion, transitions) plus the
   \`vibe.project.yaml\` / \`hyperframes.json\` / \`index.html\` scaffold.
   In Plan H this **also installs local composition rules** at the
   right place for your host (\`.claude/skills/hyperframes/\` for Claude
   Code, \`.cursor/rules/hyperframes.mdc\` for Cursor, universal
   \`SKILL.md\` for everyone else).
2. Read \`SKILL.md\` (or the host-specific copy) — Hyperframes
   framework rules, motion principles, type system, transition recipes.
3. Read \`DESIGN.md\` — project-specific palette / typography / motion
   signature (visual identity hard-gate).
4. Author each scene HTML directly under \`compositions/scene-<id>.html\`
   using the rules from steps 2 and 3. The skill enforces the visual
   identity contract — scenes that contradict DESIGN.md fail lint.
5. \`vibe scene lint --fix\` for mechanical issues, \`vibe render my-promo\`
   to MP4.

## Quick-draft path

\`\`\`bash
vibe init my-promo -r 16:9 -d 30
vibe scene add intro --style announcement \\
    --headline "Ship videos, not clicks"
vibe scene lint
vibe render my-promo
\`\`\`

\`vibe init\` is **idempotent** — running it on an existing Hyperframes
directory merges \`hyperframes.json\` instead of clobbering it. Safe to
invoke on user-provided projects.

## Subcommands

\`\`\`bash
# Project flow (top-level — preferred entry points)
vibe init <dir> [-r 16:9|9:16|1:1|4:5] [-d <sec>] [--visual-style "<name>"]
vibe build [<dir>] [--mode agent|batch|auto]         # H3 dispatch
vibe render [<dir>] [--fps 30] [--quality standard] [--format mp4]

# Lower-level scene authoring
vibe scene list-styles [<name>]                   # list / show vendored visual identities
vibe scene install-skill [<dir>] [--host all]  # retroactive composition-rules install
vibe scene add <name> --style <preset> [...]
vibe scene compose-prompts [<dir>] [--beat <id>]   # H2: emit plan, no LLM call
vibe scene lint [<root>] [--json] [--fix]
\`\`\`

## Style presets (for \`vibe scene add --style\`)

- **simple** — backdrop + bottom caption (default)
- **announcement** — single huge headline, gradient text
- **explainer** — kicker + title + subtitle stack
- **kinetic-type** — words animate in word-by-word
- **product-shot** — corner label + bottom headline + slow zoom

All presets accept \`--narration <text|file>\`, \`--visuals <prompt>\`,
\`--headline\`, \`--kicker\`. With \`--narration\`, scene duration auto-derives
from the generated TTS audio.

## STORYBOARD-to-MP4 (one command, v0.60+)

\`\`\`bash
vibe init my-promo --visual-style "Swiss Pulse" -d 12
# (edit STORYBOARD.md with per-beat YAML cues — narration, backdrop, duration)
vibe build my-promo
\`\`\`

\`vibe build\` reads the STORYBOARD frontmatter + per-beat cues,
dispatches TTS + image-gen per beat, then either:

- **\`--mode agent\`** (default when an agent host is detected) — emits a
  \`needs-author\` plan via \`vibe scene compose-prompts\`. The host agent
  authors each \`compositions/scene-<id>.html\` itself, then re-invoking
  \`vibe build\` proceeds to lint + render.
- **\`--mode batch\`** — VibeFrame runs an internal LLM (Claude / OpenAI /
  Gemini) to compose the HTML, then renders.

\`VIBE_BUILD_MODE\` env var overrides the auto-resolve.

## Lint feedback loop

\`\`\`bash
vibe scene lint --json --fix
\`\`\`

Returns structured findings. The recommended loop: 1) run lint with
\`--fix\` (mechanical fixes applied), 2) if \`errorCount > 0\`, edit the
scene HTML, 3) re-lint. Cap retries at 3 — if errors persist, fall back
to a template preset (\`vibe scene add <id> --style simple --force\`)
and surface the error to the user.

## When to use VibeFrame vs raw Hyperframes

| Task | Tool |
|------|------|
| Generate narration + image, then author scene | \`vibe scene add\` |
| Generate a full scenes project from a STORYBOARD | \`vibe build\` |
| Hand-tweak a single scene's animation | edit \`compositions/<file>.html\` directly |
| Render the project | \`vibe render\` (one canonical entry point) |
| Lint | \`vibe scene lint\` *or* \`npx hyperframes lint\` (equivalent) |

The \`vibe\` CLI adds asset generation, AI orchestration, and pipeline
integration on top of Hyperframes' rendering primitives.

## Quality checklist before render

- [ ] \`vibe scene lint\` exits 0 (or only warnings)
- [ ] \`vibe doctor\` confirms a usable Chrome (required for render)
- [ ] Root \`data-duration\` matches the sum of clip durations
- [ ] Aspect ratio in \`vibe.project.yaml\` matches the destination platform
`;

const PIPELINE_WALKTHROUGH = `# YAML pipelines (Video as Code)

A pipeline is a YAML manifest with steps that reference each other's
outputs. \`vibe run pipeline.yaml\` executes them with checkpointing and
cost estimation.

## Minimal skeleton

\`\`\`yaml
name: promo-video
description: 15s product teaser
steps:
  - id: backdrop
    action: generate-image
    prompt: "sleek product shot on white background"
    output: backdrop.png
  - id: scene
    action: generate-video
    image: $backdrop.output        # reference previous step output
    prompt: "slow camera pan"
    duration: 5
    output: scene.mp4
  - id: voice
    action: generate-tts
    text: "Meet the new standard."
    output: voice.mp3
  - id: final
    action: compose
    video: $scene.output
    audio: $voice.output
    output: final.mp4
\`\`\`

## Supported actions

- \`generate-image\`, \`generate-video\`, \`generate-tts\`, \`generate-music\`,
  \`generate-sound-effect\`, \`generate-storyboard\`, \`generate-motion\`
- \`edit-silence-cut\`, \`edit-jump-cut\`, \`edit-caption\`, \`edit-grade\`,
  \`edit-reframe\`, \`edit-speed-ramp\`, \`edit-fade\`, \`edit-noise-reduce\`,
  \`edit-text-overlay\`, \`edit-motion-overlay\`, \`edit-fill-gaps\`
- \`analyze-media\`, \`analyze-video\`, \`analyze-review\`, \`analyze-suggest\`
- \`audio-transcribe\`, \`audio-isolate\`, \`audio-voice-clone\`, \`audio-dub\`,
  \`audio-duck\`
- \`detect-scenes\`, \`detect-silence\`, \`detect-beats\`
- \`compose\`, \`export\`
- \`scene-build\` (Plan H one-shot driver) and \`scene-render\`
- \`compose-scenes-with-skills\` (internal-LLM compose pass)

The full set lives in \`packages/cli/src/pipeline/executor.ts\`.

## Variable references

- \`$<step-id>.output\` — previous step's output path
- \`$<step-id>.result.<field>\` — structured field from JSON result
- \`\${ENV_VAR}\` — environment variable
- Values can be templated: \`"\${SCRIPT_TITLE} - Episode \${EPISODE}"\`

## Running

\`\`\`bash
vibe run pipeline.yaml --dry-run           # plan + cost estimate, no execution
vibe run pipeline.yaml                     # execute
vibe run pipeline.yaml --resume            # retry from last successful step
vibe run pipeline.yaml --from scene        # start at specific step
vibe run pipeline.yaml --provider-video kling   # override provider
\`\`\`

Checkpoints land next to the YAML: \`pipeline.yaml.checkpoint.json\`.

## Authoring tips

1. **Start from a tiny YAML** — keep it in your project directory and run
   \`vibe run pipeline.yaml --dry-run\` before spending provider budget.
2. **Dry-run first** — you see estimated cost and resolved variable
   graph before spending API credits.
3. **Keep step ids short and descriptive** (\`intro\`, \`scene1\`, \`voice\`,
   \`bgm\`) — they appear in logs and variable refs.
4. **Name outputs** with extensions matching the action (\`.mp4\`, \`.mp3\`,
   \`.png\`, \`.json\`).
5. **Declare \`budget:\`** on expensive pipelines:
   \`\`\`yaml
   budget:
     tokens: 500_000
     max_tool_errors: 3
     cost_usd: 5.00
   \`\`\`
6. **Split large pipelines** into smaller YAML files and compose via
   \`action: run-pipeline\` (nested).

## Converting ad-hoc shell sessions to pipelines

When the user has a working shell sequence, extract steps:

- Each \`vibe ...\` command becomes one step
- File outputs become step outputs; downstream \`-i <file>\` references
  become \`$<id>.output\`
- Shared parameters move to a top-level \`defaults:\` section
- Wrap the entire chain in a \`name:\` + \`steps:\` skeleton

The \`compose\` action is the catch-all assembly step (audio mux, video
overlay, etc.) — useful at the tail of a pipeline.
`;

const ARCHITECTURE_WALKTHROUGH = `# vibe agent / build / run — when to pick which

The CLI has three orchestrating commands that coordinate other primitives:
\`vibe agent\`, \`vibe build\`, \`vibe run\`. New users routinely ask which one
they want for a given task. The full audit lives in
[\`docs/cli-architecture.md\`](../../../docs/cli-architecture.md); this
guide is the operator-facing summary.

If you already use Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, Aider, Gemini CLI, OpenCode,
or another coding agent, let that host drive \`vibe\` directly through shell
commands plus \`AGENTS.md\` / \`CLAUDE.md\`. \`vibe agent\` is the optional
built-in fallback when you do not already have an agent host.

## TL;DR

| | \`vibe agent\` | \`vibe build\` | \`vibe run\` |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Driving input** | natural-language prompt | \`STORYBOARD.md\` | YAML pipeline file |
| **Interactivity** | REPL or one-shot | one-shot | one-shot |
| **Reproducibility** | none | high (idempotent) | highest (checkpointed) |
| **Budget caps** | per-session max-turns | none | \`--budget-usd\`, \`--budget-tokens\`, \`--max-errors\` |
| **Resume after crash** | no | re-invoke | \`--resume\` |
| **Best for** | optional built-in exploration | finished script | repeatable workflows |

## Decision tree

- "I am already in Claude Code/Codex/Cursor/etc." → regular \`vibe\` shell commands + \`vibe guide\` / \`vibe schema\`
- "I want to play and do not have an external coding agent" → \`vibe agent\`
- "I have a finished script + visual identity" → \`vibe build\`
- "I want this to run again next month" → \`vibe run\`

If two seem to fit, pick the rightmost one — more reproducible, less surprise.

## Cost-tier awareness (v0.83+)

Every primitive subcommand carries a cost tier (\`free\` / \`low\` / \`high\` /
\`very-high\`). \`vibe schema --list\` exposes the tier as JSON, and each
\`vibe <group> <sub> --help\` page shows it as a colored footer. Use
\`vibe doctor --test-keys\` before kicking off any high-cost orchestrator —
a single bad key wastes time and money.

## Cross-command primitives

All three commands ultimately call the same primitives:
\`generate\` / \`edit\` / \`audio\` / \`inspect\` / \`detect\` / \`remix\`. The
agent calls them through a tool manifest; \`build\` calls a curated subset
(TTS + image + compose + render); \`run\` exposes 55+ actions one per primitive.

## Known overlap

- \`vibe build\` is conceptually a 4-step pipeline; \`vibe run\` could express
  the same flow but build's STORYBOARD.md input + opinionated defaults are
  the value-add.
- \`vibe agent\`'s tool registry currently exposes primitives, not
  orchestrators. Adding \`vibe.build\` / \`vibe.run\` as agent tools is on the
  table for a future major.
- \`vibe run --resume\` has no analog in build/agent; build's idempotent
  re-invoke covers the common case.
`;

const MOTION_WALKTHROUGH = `# Motion graphics with vibe

Use this guide when the user asks for titles, lower-thirds, animated
typography, grain, vignettes, logo bugs, or other designed overlays.

## Decision tree

| User intent | Command |
|---|---|
| Simple static text burn-in | \`vibe edit text-overlay\` |
| Designed/animated overlay on an existing clip | \`vibe edit motion-overlay\` |
| Standalone motion graphic asset | \`vibe generate motion\` |
| Overlay must fit the actual clip | \`vibe edit motion-overlay --understand auto\` |
| User already has a Lottie file | \`vibe edit motion-overlay --asset logo.lottie\` |

## Recommended path

1. Inspect or understand the base clip only when placement matters.
2. Use \`vibe edit motion-overlay <video> "description" --understand auto -o out.mp4\`
   for animated title/lower-third/brand overlays.
3. Use \`vibe edit text-overlay\` only for simple static text.
4. Use \`vibe generate motion\` when the desired output is the motion asset
   itself, not an edited input video.
5. For Lottie, bring a user-provided \`.json\` or \`.lottie\` file and overlay it
   with \`--asset\`; prompt-to-Lottie generation is intentionally out of scope.

## Examples

\`\`\`bash
vibe edit motion-overlay clip.mp4 \\
  "minimal lower-third title 'Day One', bottom-left, fade in at 1s, hold 3s, fade out" \\
  --understand auto \\
  -o clip-titled.mp4

vibe edit motion-overlay clip.mp4 \\
  --asset assets/logo.lottie \\
  --position bottom-right \\
  --scale 0.18 \\
  --start 1 \\
  --duration 4 \\
  -o clip-logo.mp4

vibe generate motion "animated product logo reveal" --render -o logo-reveal.mp4
