/**
 * @module manifest/walkthrough
 * @description Universal guide primitive — host-agnostic equivalent of
 * Claude Code's `/vibe-scene` and `/vibe-pipeline` slash commands.
 *
 * Any agent host (Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, Aider, Gemini CLI, OpenCode)
 * can invoke `guide` to load the same step-by-step authoring guide
 * the slash commands deliver. Source content is vendored as TS template
 * literals (see `commands/_shared/walkthroughs/`) so the bundle has zero
 * filesystem dependencies.
