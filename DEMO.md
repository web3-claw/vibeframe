# VibeFrame Demo

This is the copy-paste demo path for VibeFrame as a general video CLI.

It covers:

1. Check local setup
2. Generate image and video assets
3. Attach generated media to a storyboard scene
4. Build a storyboard-based video project
5. Run the same idea as YAML
6. Validate the produced files

Commands below use `pnpm vibe` because this repo is checked out locally. For an
installed CLI, replace `pnpm vibe` with `vibe`.

---

## 0. Check Setup

Run these first:

```bash
pnpm vibe --help
pnpm vibe setup --show
pnpm vibe doctor
```

For the full demo, these keys should be available:

```text
OPENAI_API_KEY    text-to-image
FAL_KEY           Seedance text/image-to-video through fal.ai
IMGBB_API_KEY     local image upload host for image-to-video
```

The storyboard project demo below uses `--tts kokoro`, so it does not require a
paid TTS key.

Useful guide command:

```bash
pnpm vibe walkthrough
pnpm vibe walkthrough scene
pnpm vibe walkthrough pipeline
```

`walkthrough` explains the workflow. It does not create files.

---

## 1. Quick Media Smoke

These commands create standalone media assets in `demo-output/`.

```bash
mkdir -p demo-output
```

### 1.1 Text to Image

```bash
pnpm vibe generate image \
  "A polished VibeFrame CLI demo hero frame: a modern terminal window producing cinematic video assets, subtle timeline elements, crisp product-documentation style, 16:9 composition, high contrast, no readable brand logos" \
  -p openai \
  -m 2 \
  --size 1536x1024 \
  --quality hd \
  -o demo-output/vibe-cli-generated-image.png
```

Expected file:

```text
demo-output/vibe-cli-generated-image.png
```

### 1.2 Text to Video

```bash
pnpm vibe generate video \
  "A modern VibeFrame CLI product demo in motion: terminal commands trigger generated frames, a cinematic timeline assembles, clean UI panels animate smoothly, polished developer-tool promo, no readable text, 16:9" \
  -p seedance \
  -d 5 \
  -r 16:9 \
  -o demo-output/vibe-cli-generated-video.mp4
```

Expected file:

```text
demo-output/vibe-cli-generated-video.mp4
```

Notes:

- `-p seedance` means ByteDance Seedance 2.0 through fal.ai.
- `-d 5` is used to keep demo cost and queue time low.
- Seedance supports longer clips too, for example `-d 10` or `-d 15`.
- `-p fal` still works as a backward-compatible alias, but demos should use
  `-p seedance`.

### 1.3 Image to Video

Use the image from step 1.1:

```bash
pnpm vibe generate video \
  "The terminal UI comes alive: timeline tracks slide into place, rendered frames glow, a clean cinematic product-demo motion, smooth camera push-in, professional documentation demo style, no extra text" \
  -p seedance \
  -i demo-output/vibe-cli-generated-image.png \
  -d 5 \
  -r 16:9 \
  -o demo-output/vibe-cli-generated-i2v-video.mp4
```

Expected file:

```text
demo-output/vibe-cli-generated-i2v-video.mp4
```

Seedance image-to-video needs an HTTPS image URL. The CLI uploads local images
through ImgBB first, so `IMGBB_API_KEY` must be valid when using `-i` with
Seedance or Kling.

---

## 2. Storyboard to Composed Video

This is the main project flow:

```text
vibe init -> edit STORYBOARD.md / DESIGN.md -> vibe build -> vibe render
```

A local-narration sample exists at:

```text
my-video/
```

Final rendered file:

```text
my-video/renders/my-video-final.mp4
```

### 2.1 Create a New Video Project

This command is idempotent. If `my-video` already exists, it keeps
the existing authored files and merges only missing support files.

```bash
pnpm vibe init my-video \
  --profile agent \
  --visual-style "Swiss Pulse" \
  -r 16:9 \
  -d 18
```

Open these two files first:

```text
my-video/STORYBOARD.md
my-video/DESIGN.md
```

`vibe init` creates a few support files because this is both a VibeFrame
project and a render project.

| Profile | Command | What it creates |
|---|---|---|
| Minimal | `--profile minimal` | `STORYBOARD.md`, `DESIGN.md`, `vibe.project.yaml`, `.gitignore` |
| Agent | `--profile agent` | Minimal files plus `SKILL.md`, `references/`, `CLAUDE.md` |
| Full | `--profile full` | Agent files plus render scaffold: `index.html`, `compositions/`, `assets/`, `renders/`, backend metadata |

Recommended default: `--profile agent`.

The default `agent` profile does not create `hyperframes.json` up front. That
file is backend metadata for the current HTML renderer and appears only when
you choose `--profile full` or when `vibe build` needs to add the render
scaffold.

### 2.2 Preview the Build

Start with dry-run. This prints the plan without creating assets or spending
provider budget:

```bash
pnpm vibe build my-video \
  --dry-run
```

### 2.3 Build the Sample Project

The sample has hand-authored composition HTML and uses local Kokoro narration,
so it can exercise the build flow without paid image or video provider calls:

```bash
pnpm vibe build my-video \
  --mode agent \
  --tts kokoro \
  --skip-backdrop \
  --skip-render
```

With `--skip-render`, this prepares narration/assets and validates the scene
plan without exporting the final MP4. If a beat is missing, `--mode agent`
returns a plan telling the host agent which `compositions/scene-*.html` files
to author. Run `vibe render` after the project is ready.

To exercise the full paid AI image asset path, remove `--skip-backdrop` and
choose the image provider you want.

### 2.4 Lint the Project

```bash
pnpm vibe scene lint index.html \
  --project my-video \
  --fix
```

Expected result:

```text
No fatal lint errors.
```

Info-level messages about CDN scripts are okay for this demo.

### 2.5 Render the Final MP4

```bash
pnpm vibe render my-video \
  -o renders/my-video-final.mp4 \
  --quality standard
```

Expected file:

```text
my-video/renders/my-video-final.mp4
```

Expected shape:

```text
H.264 + AAC MP4
1920x1080
30fps
about 33 seconds
```

The final duration is longer than the storyboard minimums because generated
narration extends each beat so speech is not cut off.

The sample includes four beats. The fourth beat demonstrates the important AI
media pattern:

```text
generate image -> generate video -> add storyboard beat -> compose scene -> render final video
```

The Seedance image-to-video output is stored as:

```text
my-video/assets/my-video-ai-motion.mp4
```

For the composed demo, the rendered scene uses a derived hold clip:

```text
my-video/assets/my-video-ai-motion-held.mp4
```

That file trims the Seedance clip before its ending reset and freezes the last
useful frame until the storyboard scene ends.

The visual layout for that beat is:

```text
my-video/compositions/scene-media.html
```

The timed video element itself is mounted in the root timeline:

```text
my-video/index.html
id="seedance-motion-overlay"
```

This means the Seedance clip is not treated as the final video by itself. It is
used as one visual asset inside the broader storyboard timeline, alongside
narration, layout, captions, and other scene animation.

---

## 3. Video as YAML

VibeFrame has two YAML surfaces. Use the one that matches the job.

### 3.1 STORYBOARD.md

Use this for a composed video project.

Example beat:

````markdown
## Beat hook — Storyboard becomes a render plan

```yaml
narration: "Start with a storyboard. VibeFrame turns each beat into a render plan an agent can execute."
backdrop: "A precise developer terminal beside structured storyboard cues, dark interface, blue grid lines"
duration: 5
```
````

Run:

```bash
pnpm vibe build my-video \
  --mode agent \
  --tts kokoro \
  --skip-backdrop \
  --skip-render
```

### 3.2 Pipeline YAML

Use this for a reproducible multi-step workflow.

The local-narration sample file is:

```text
my-video/video-as-yaml.yaml
```

Preview cost and steps:

```bash
pnpm vibe run my-video/video-as-yaml.yaml \
  -o . \
  --dry-run
```

Execute:

```bash
pnpm vibe run my-video/video-as-yaml.yaml \
  -o .
```

The pipeline does:

```text
scene-build -> scene-render
```

Expected file:

```text
my-video/renders/my-video-yaml-final.mp4
```

Reference YAML:

```yaml
name: my-video-yaml
budget:
  costUsd: 0
  maxToolErrors: 1
steps:
  - id: build
    action: scene-build
    project: my-video
    mode: agent
    tts: kokoro
    skipBackdrop: true
    skipRender: true

  - id: render
    action: scene-render
    project: my-video
    output: renders/my-video-yaml-final.mp4
    quality: standard
    fps: 30
    format: mp4
```

`-o .` makes `project: my-video` resolve to
`my-video`.

For paid text-to-image -> image-to-video YAML, see
`my-video/ai-media.yaml`.

### 3.3 AI Media Layer

This optional path demonstrates the part that goes beyond Hyperframes-style
HTML composition: VibeFrame can orchestrate AI image/video providers and keep
those assets next to the composed project.

Preview:

```bash
pnpm vibe run my-video/ai-media.yaml \
  -o my-video/assets \
  --dry-run
```

Execute:

```bash
pnpm vibe run my-video/ai-media.yaml \
  -o my-video/assets \
  --budget-usd 6
```

The pipeline does:

```text
generate-image -> generate-video
```

Expected files:

```text
my-video/assets/my-video-ai-hero.png
my-video/assets/my-video-ai-motion.mp4
my-video/assets/my-video-ai-motion-held.mp4
```

Expected shape after execution:

```text
my-video-ai-hero.png     PNG image
my-video-ai-motion.mp4   H.264 MP4, 1280x720, 24fps, about 5 seconds
my-video-ai-motion-held.mp4
                           H.264 MP4, 1280x720, 24fps, about 8.6 seconds
```

Required keys:

```text
OPENAI_API_KEY
FAL_KEY
IMGBB_API_KEY
```

After these files exist, run section 2 again. The fourth storyboard beat will
pick up the generated clip through the root `seedance-motion-overlay` video
element while `compositions/scene-media.html` controls the scene layout. This
keeps the video on the absolute storyboard timeline, which is important for
frame extraction during screenshot capture mode.

---

## 4. Validate Outputs

Inspect the final storyboard video:

```bash
ffprobe -v error \
  -show_entries stream=index,codec_type,codec_name,width,height,r_frame_rate,duration \
  -show_entries format=duration,size \
  -of json \
  my-video/renders/my-video-final.mp4
```

Inspect the YAML-rendered video:

```bash
ffprobe -v error \
  -show_entries stream=index,codec_type,codec_name,width,height,r_frame_rate,duration \
  -show_entries format=duration,size \
  -of json \
  my-video/renders/my-video-yaml-final.mp4
```

Run focused tests:

```bash
pnpm -F @vibeframe/cli test -- \
  src/commands/_shared/scene-build.test.ts \
  src/commands/_shared/scene-audio-mux.test.ts \
  src/commands/_shared/scene-project.test.ts \
  --run
```

## 5. Command Map

| Goal | Command |
|---|---|
| Start a video project | `pnpm vibe init my-video --profile agent` |
| Build storyboard assets/compositions | `pnpm vibe build my-video` |
| Render project to MP4 | `pnpm vibe render my-video` |
| Generate a standalone image | `pnpm vibe generate image "..."` |
| Generate a standalone video | `pnpm vibe generate video "..." -p seedance` |
| Run a YAML workflow | `pnpm vibe run workflow.yaml` |
| Learn the scene workflow | `pnpm vibe walkthrough scene` |
| Learn the YAML workflow | `pnpm vibe walkthrough pipeline` |

Advanced namespace:

```text
vibe scene ...
```

Use `vibe scene ...` when you need lower-level scene commands such as
`scene lint`, `scene install-skill`, `scene compose-prompts`, or `scene add`.

## 6. Legacy Terminal Recordings

The VHS terminal recordings still live in [`assets/demos/`](assets/demos/).
They are useful for docs and short product clips, but the primary demo path is
now CLI-first and artifact-first:

```text
run vibe -> inspect files -> render MP4
```
